            <p><strong>DAWN OF OUROBOROS</strong> is a blackened progressive metal project that is making waves across the globe with a unique blend of death, post, and atmospheric sub-genres built upon an
            intoxicating European Black Metal influence . Founded and helmed by guitarist Tony Thomas
            (<strong>BOTANIST, CAILLEACH CALLING</strong>) and vocalist Chelsea Murphy (<strong>CAILLEACH
            CALLING</strong>, Session Vocalist) <strong>DAWN OF OUROBOROS</strong> took shape over the course of the last several years. They released their debut album <q><strong>The Art of Morphology</strong></q> to international critical acclaim in 2020. The album was praised for its emotional impact and originality.
            
            In Fall of 2021 they set out on their first tour as a band with the melodic extreme metal band <strong>VINTERSEA</strong>. Following the success of this tour, the band was quickly signed to long standing heavy metal label Prosthetic Records. Their second album, and first
            release via Prosthetic Records, <q><strong>Velvet Incandescence</strong></q> was released in Spring of
            2023. The album expanded on the complex textures of their debut instrumentally, while vocalist 
            
            Chelsea Murphy expanded her range as both an extreme vocalist and singer.
             The album painted a detailed visual and sonic landscape of color and emotion. <q><strong>Velvet Incandescence</strong></q> led the band to earning their first national tour supporting long-standing progressive metal bands <strong>FALLUJAH</strong>, and <strong>PERSEFONE</strong> in the summer of 2024.
           
             On this tour, the band earned praise from their peers, and audiences across North America. Carrying a strong momentum into 2025, the band released their third album <q><strong>Bioluminescence</strong></q> in March of 2025. <q><strong>Bioluminescence</strong></q> demonstrated that the band has fully established their sound a modern metal act to be reckoned with. On this album, they explored more progressive elements by incorporating odd time signatures, more complex harmonic elements, and an ever-increasing display of vocal diversity. 
             
             This album earned the band their greatest amount of
             international press to date. With features in long-standing metal magazines such as Decibel, and Kerrang! Following the success of a headline west coast tour with <strong>WOLF KING</strong>, the band was offered a support tour with sludge metal legends <strong>BARONESS</strong>. In the second half of 2025, the band aims to continue touring, and to start working on the next chapter of their musical journey.
