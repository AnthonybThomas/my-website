            <p><strong>DAWN OF OUROBOROS</strong> is a blackened progressive metal project that is making waves across
                the globe with a unique blend of death, post, and atmospheric sub-genres built upon an
                intoxicating European Black Metal influence . Founded and helmed by guitarist Tony Thomas
                (<strong>BOTANIST, CAILLEACH CALLING</strong>) and vocalist Chelsea Murphy (<strong>CAILLEACH
                    CALLING</strong>, Session Vocalist) <strong>DAWN OF OUROBOROS</strong> took shape over the course of
                the last several years. They released their debut album <q><strong>The Art of Morphology</strong></q> to
                international critical acclaim in 2020. The album was praised for its emotional impact and originality.

                    In Fall of 2021 they set out on their first tour as a band with the melodic extreme metal band
                <strong>VINTERSEA</strong>. Following the success of this tour, the band was quickly signed to long
                standing heavy metal label Prosthetic Records. Their second album, and first
                release via Prosthetic Records, <q><strong>Velvet Incandescence</strong></q> was released in Spring of
                2023. The album expanded on the complex textures of their debut instrumentally, while vocalist

                    Chelsea Murphy expanded her range as both an extreme vocalist and singer.
                The album painted a detailed visual and sonic landscape of color and emotion. <q><strong>Velvet
                        Incandescence</strong></q> led the band to earning their first national tour supporting
                long-standing progressive metal bands <strong>FALLUJAH</strong>, and <strong>PERSEFONE</strong> in the
                summer of 2024.

                 On this tour, the band earned praise from their peers, and audiences across North America. Carrying a
                strong momentum into 2025, the band released their third album <q><strong>Bioluminescence</strong></q>
                in March of 2025. <q><strong>Bioluminescence</strong></q> demonstrated that the band has fully
                established their sound a modern metal act to be reckoned with. On this album, they explored more
                progressive elements by incorporating odd time signatures, more complex harmonic elements, and an
                ever-increasing display of vocal diversity.

                 This album earned the band their greatest amount of
                international press to date. With features in long-standing metal magazines such as Decibel, and
                Kerrang! Following the success of a headline west coast tour with <strong>WOLF KING</strong>, the band
                was offered a support tour with sludge metal legends <strong>BARONESS</strong>. In the second half of
                2025, the band aims to continue touring, and to start working on the next chapter of their musical
                journey.
